# [WIP] Resources for Career Development in Data Science

This repository aims at compiling comprehensive resources for career development in data science.

Data science is relativey a new discipline. It started only in around 2010, and soon after, it became extrememly popular and Harvard Business Review named data scientist as the sexiest job in the 21st century.

Despite its popularity, the career paths in data science are not well defined. The roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines of data scientists vary from one organization to another. Also data science programs at schools and companies offer trainig with different focuses. Therefore, it is hard for aspiring data scientists to plan for their career development.

To simplify, there are three main career paths in data science, (1) data analytics, (2) machine learning research, and (3) machine learning engineering. While all three paths are relevent to any data scientists, one can progress one's career by focusing on either one or a combination of these paths.

In this repository, I am planning to add resouces in three main career paths, such as career advices and interviews of senior data scientists/managers (if you are one of these people, I may reach out to you. ;)).

Any contribution and feedback will be appreciated.
